# Tactical Intelligence

## Tactical Intelligence

* **Tactical Intelligence**: Also known as technical intelligence, it is short-term and focuses on immediate threats. It includes information like Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as file hashes, malicious domains, and IP addresses.
* **Purpose**: The main goal is to provide actionable information quickly to those who need it, helping in making rapid decisions to block or allow actions and sometimes shut down threats.\

*   **Benefits**:

    * Provides context and relevance to large amounts of data.
    * Helps filter out noise and turn data into actionable intelligence.
    * Empowers organizations to be proactive in their cybersecurity posture.
    * Identifies vulnerabilities and patterns of adversarial behavior.


*   **Shortcomings**:

    * Short-term in nature, as some IOCs can become obsolete quickly.
    * Needs timely and high-quality sources to avoid false positives.


* **Audience**: Intended for technical personnel like system architects, administrators, and security staff who are directly involved in defending the organization.\
