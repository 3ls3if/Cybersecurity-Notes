# Heatmap Analysis

## Heatmap Analysis

**Heatmap Analysis** is a technique used to visualize data, making it easier to identify trends and patterns.\
\
**What is a Heatmap?**

* A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where values are depicted by color.
* It uses a warm-to-cool color spectrum to show activity levels, with red indicating high activity and green indicating low activity.

\
**Why Use Heatmaps in Cyber Threat Intelligence?**

* Heatmaps help make complex data sets comprehensible and actionable.
* They allow you to quickly see trends and understand what actions to take next.
* In cyber threat intelligence, heatmaps can show intrusion attempts and help identify knowledge gaps about adversaries.

\
**Creating a Heatmap in Excel**

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Create an Excel spreadsheet with rows representing activities per month and columns representing different campaigns.
2. **Select Data**: Highlight the numerical data you want to visualize.
3.  **Apply Conditional Formatting**:

    * Go to the Home menu.
    * Choose Conditional Formatting.
    * Select a color scale (e.g., red to green) where red indicates the highest activity level.


4. **Analyze Results**: Look at the heatmap to identify high activity periods (red areas) and low activity periods (green areas).

\
**Benefits of Heatmap Analysis**

* **Identify Trends**: Quickly see periods of high and low activity.
* **Understand Adversaries**: Determine patterns in intrusion attempts, such as increased activity during certain months.
* **Prioritize Actions**: Use the insights to decide on the best course of action to address threats.\
