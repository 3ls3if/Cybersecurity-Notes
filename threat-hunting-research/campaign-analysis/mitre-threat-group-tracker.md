# MITRE Threat Group Tracker

## MITRE Threat Group Tracker



**MITRE ATT\&CK Framework**

* **What It Is**: A knowledge base of adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers.
* **Purpose**: Helps organizations move towards a threat-informed defense by understanding and mitigating attacker behaviors.
* **Components**:
  * **Tactics**: The "why" of an attack (e.g., initial access, execution).
  * **Techniques**: The "how" of an attack (e.g., phishing, malware).
  * **Common Knowledge**: Documented behaviors and methods used by attackers.

\
**Benefits of MITRE ATT\&CK**

* **Standardization**: Provides a common language for describing adversary behavior, making it easier to share and compare threat intelligence.
* **Visualization**: Allows organizations to map their defense systems and identify strengths and weaknesses.
* **Prioritization**: Helps determine which techniques to focus on for mitigation and detection based on their relevance to specific threats.

\
**MITRE Threat Group Tracker**

* **What It Is**: A framework for tracking related intrusion activities by a common name in the security community.
* **Purpose**: Helps analysts track clusters of activities and understand the behavior of different threat groups.
* **Components**:
  * **Threat Groups**: Sets of related intrusion activities tracked by a common name.
  * **Activity Groups**: Clusters of activities using various analytic methodologies.
  * **Campaigns**: Specific intrusion sets or threat actors.

\
**Practical Use Case**

* **Example**: Comparing techniques used by APT3 (China-based) and APT29 (Russia-based).
  * **Color Coding**: Techniques unique to APT3 are blue, unique to APT29 are yellow, and common techniques are green.
  * **Prioritization**: Techniques in green (common to both groups) are high priority for mitigation and detection.

\
**How to Use MITRE ATT\&CK**

* **Start Small**: Begin with a single threat group and analyze their behaviors using the ATT\&CK framework.
* **Leverage Tools**: Use products and tools that map to ATT\&CK to enhance your analysis.
* **Collaborate**: Work with other analysts and defenders to compare and contrast threat groups and improve your defense strategies.\
