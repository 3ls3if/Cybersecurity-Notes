# Introduction

## Introduction to Campaigns

**What is a Campaign?**

* A campaign is a series of incidents that occur over a specific time period and are related by shared indicators, tools, infrastructure, or TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).
* These incidents are performed by the same threat actors or have a shared objective.

\
**Starting a Campaign Analysis**

* **Identify Trends**: Look for patterns in intrusions over time.
* **Keep Detailed Reports**: Maintain detailed incident reports, including indicators, as they can be useful for future analysis.
* **Use External Intelligence**: Collect intelligence from multiple sources like iSaaS, ISOs, vendors, and resources.

\
**Key Indicators**

* Consistent indicators across intrusions help identify whether the trend targets a specific sector, country, or organization.
* Compare key indicators and TTPs to identify adversaries.

\
**Techniques for Campaign Analysis**

* **ACH (Analysis of Competing Hypothesis)**: Replace hypothesis with campaign hypothesis and identify candidate campaigns for correlations.
* **Cyber Kill Chain and Diamond Model**: Use these models to correlate intrusions based on key indicators.
* **Other Techniques**: Data analysis, temporal analysis, visual analysis, and heatmap analysis.

\
**Importance of Campaign Analysis**

* Helps anticipate future intrusions.
* Even unsuccessful intrusions are useful as adversaries may try them again.\
