# Threat Hunting

## Essentials of  Threat Hunting

**What is Threat Hunting?**

* **Definition:** Threat hunting is a proactive cybersecurity strategy used to identify hidden threats within a network. Unlike traditional methods that rely on automated systems to detect known threats, threat hunting involves actively searching for potential threats that may have slipped through the cracks.
* **Analogy:** Think of your network as a fortress. Automated systems are like guards at the gate, stopping known intruders. Threat hunting is like having a team of detectives inside the fortress, constantly on the lookout for any signs of trouble.

\
**Why is Threat Hunting Important?**

* **Purpose:** It helps you stay one step ahead of attackers by identifying threats that automated systems might miss.
* **Analogy:** It's like having a security team that not only reacts to alarms but also looks for signs of someone trying to sneak in.

\
**How to Get Started with Threat Hunting?**

1.  **Hypothesis-Driven Investigations:**

    * **Concept:** Start with a hypothesis, such as "What if an attacker is using a new type of malware that our systems can't detect?"
    * **Process:** Gather data and look for evidence to support or refute your hypothesis.


2. **Techniques:**
   *   **Anomaly Detection:**

       * **Concept:** Look for unusual patterns or behaviors within your network.
       * **Example:** If you notice a user accessing sensitive data at odd hours, it could be a red flag.


   * **TTP Analysis (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures):**
     * **Concept:** Study the methods used by cyber criminals and look for signs that they may be using similar methods in your network.\

3. **Tools:**
   * **Variety:** There are many tools available for threat hunting, from advanced analytics platforms to open-source software.
   * **Key:** Choose tools that fit your needs and integrate well with your existing systems.

\
**Mindset for Threat Hunting?**

* **Curiosity:** Always be curious and willing to dig deeper.
* **Skepticism:** Be skeptical and constantly ask, "What if?"
* **Analogy:** Think like an attacker to anticipate their moves and find potential threats.

## Getting Started With Threat Hunting

**Threat Hunting Process**

1.  **Forming a Hypothesis:**

    * **Concept:** Start with a question or assumption about a potential threat. For example, "What if an attacker is using a new type of malware that our current systems can't detect?"
    * **Purpose:** This hypothesis guides your investigation and helps you focus on specific areas of your network.


2. **Gathering Data:**
   * **Concept:** Collect logs, network traffic, and other relevant information from your systems.
   * **Purpose:** The goal is to find evidence that either supports or refutes your hypothesis. Think of it like gathering puzzle pieces to see the bigger picture.\

3. **Analyzing Data:**
   *   **Anomaly Detection:**

       * **Concept:** Look for patterns or behaviors that deviate from the norm. For example, if you notice a user accessing sensitive data at odd hours, it could be a sign of malicious activity.


   * **TTP Analysis (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures):**
     * **Concept:** Study the methods used by cyber criminals and look for similar signs in your network. This helps you identify potential threats based on known attack patterns.\

4.  **Maintaining a Proactive Mindset:**

    * **Curiosity:** Always be curious and willing to dig deeper.
    * **Skepticism:** Constantly ask "What if?" and think like an attacker to anticipate their moves.


5.  **Taking Action:**

    * **Concept:** Once you've identified a potential threat, take steps to neutralize it. This could involve isolating affected systems, removing malware, or implementing new security measures to prevent future attacks.
    * **Purpose:** The goal is to strengthen your defenses and protect your network from future threats.

## Threat Hunting Tools



**Essential Tools for Threat Hunting**

1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:**
   * **Function:** Collect and analyze log data from various sources within your network, providing a centralized view of your security landscape.
   * **Example:** Microsoft Sentinel in Azure.
     * **Capabilities:** Collects and analyzes large volumes of data, identifies advanced threats and anomalies using built-in machine learning algorithms, and can automate incident response and remediation.\

2. **Network Traffic Analyzers:**
   * **Function:** Monitor and scrutinize data flowing through your network in real time.
   * **Example:** Wireshark.
     * **Capabilities:** Allows deep inspection of network traffic, decoding various protocols, and filtering packets for analysis. It's a popular choice among security professionals and network administrators.\

3. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions:**
   * **Function:** Monitor endpoint devices for suspicious behavior and provide detailed forensic information about potential threats.
   * **Example:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
     * **Capabilities:** Helps defend against advanced persistent threats by investigating alerts, tracking attacker activity, and containing incidents.\

4. **Disassemblers or Debuggers:**
   * **Function:** Analyze malware at a low level, understanding its code and functionality.
   * **Examples:** IDA or Ghidra.
     * **Capabilities:** These tools help develop signatures, identify vulnerabilities, and create custom detection rules.

\
**Techniques for Effective Threat Hunting**

1. **Analyzing Logs:**
   * **Purpose:** Logs provide a record of events that have occurred within your network, which can be analyzed to identify unusual patterns or behaviors.\

2. **Monitoring Network Traffic:**
   * **Purpose:** By examining network traffic, you can spot unusual activities, such as unexpected data transfers or communication with suspicious IP addresses.\

3.  **Advanced Querying:**

    * **Purpose:** Use advanced queries to detect anomalies in the data collected by SIEM systems, network traffic analyzers, and EDR solutions.
