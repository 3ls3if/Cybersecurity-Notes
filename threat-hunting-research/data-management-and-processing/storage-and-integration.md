# Storage and Integration

## Storage and Integration

* **Storage**: After processing data from multiple sources, it's crucial to store it properly for future use, such as temporal and campaign analysis. Proper storage ensures compliance with data protection laws like GDPR and allows easy access for your team when needed.\

* **Integration**: Actionable indicators from your processed data need to be integrated back into your security devices and products. This helps in making your security measures more effective. However, avoid integrating non-curated or non-vetted feeds as they can generate excessive noise and alerts, overwhelming your analysts.
