# Cyber Kill Chain and Diamond Model

**Cyber Kill Chain**\
The Cyber Kill Chain is a model developed by Lockheed Martin to describe the stages an attacker goes through to compromise a target. It consists of seven steps:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target.
2. **Weaponization**: Creating a malicious payload using exploits.
3. **Delivery**: Sending the payload to the target (e.g., via phishing).
4. **Exploitation**: Exploiting a vulnerability to gain access.
5. **Installation**: Installing malware or obtaining credentials.
6. **Command and Control (C2)**: Setting up a command and control channel to navigate the network.
7. **Actions on Objectives**: Achieving the attacker's goals, such as data exfiltration.

\
**Diamond Model**\
The Diamond Model, developed by the Centre for Cyber Threat Intelligence and Threat Research, focuses on four core elements in an attack:

1. **Adversary**: The actor or group responsible for the attack.
2. **Capability**: The tools or techniques used by the adversary.
3. **Infrastructure**: The physical or logical structures used to deliver the capability (e.g., C2 servers).
4. **Victim**: The target of the attack.

**Mapping Cyber Kill Chain and Diamond Model**

Analysts understand the sequence of events and the relationships between the adversary, infrastructure, capability, and victim.

* **Reconnaissance**: The adversary gathers information about the victim.
* **Weaponization**: The adversary creates a phishing email (capability) and a malicious payload (infrastructure).
* **Delivery**: The phishing email is sent to the victim.
* **Exploitation**: The victim clicks the link, and the malware is executed.
* **Installation**: The malware installs itself on the victim's system.
* **C2**: The malware sets up a command and control channel.
* **Actions on Objectives**: The malware exfiltrates data from the victim's system.\
