# Analysis of Competing Hypothesis

## ACH Steps

The "Analysis of Competing Hypothesis" (ACH) is a technique used to evaluate multiple possible explanations for an event and determine which one is most likely based on the available evidence.

1. **Enumerate Hypotheses:** List all possible explanations without considering their feasibility.
2. **Support Hypotheses:** Gather evidence that supports or refutes each hypothesis.
3. **Compare Evidence:** Use a matrix to compare evidence for each hypothesis.
4. **Refine Matrix:** Remove non-diagnostic evidence and add any overlooked evidence.
5. **Prioritize Hypotheses:** Rank hypotheses by their likelihood based on the evidence.
6. **Determine Evidentiary Dependence:** Assess the confidence in the evidence and its impact if it were invalid.
7. **Report Conclusions:** Summarize the findings, including all considered hypotheses and key evidence.
8. **Qualify Needs:** Note that evidence may change over time and how these changes could affect conclusions.

\
The Wannacry ransomware incident is used as an example. Four hypotheses were considered:

* H1: Sophisticated financially-motivated cyber criminal actor
* H2: Unsophisticated financially-motivated cyber criminal actor
* H3: Nation-state actor conducting a disruptive operation
* H4: Nation-state actor aiming to discredit the NSA

\
After comparing the evidence, H2 (unsophisticated financially-motivated cyber criminal actor) was found to be the strongest hypothesis.\
