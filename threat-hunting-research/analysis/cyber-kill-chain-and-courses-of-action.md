# Cyber Kill Chain and Courses of Action

1.  **Cyber Kill Chain**: This is a model that outlines the steps an attacker takes to compromise a target. It includes:

    * **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target.
    * **Weaponization**: Creating a malicious payload.
    * **Delivery**: Sending the payload to the target (e.g., via phishing).
    * **Exploitation**: Using the payload to exploit a vulnerability.
    * **Installation**: Installing malware or gaining access.
    * **Command and Control (C2)**: Establishing control over the compromised system.
    * **Actions on Objectives**: Achieving the attacker's goals, such as data exfiltration.


2.  **Courses of Action Matrix**: This model helps defenders decide how to respond to each phase of the Cyber Kill Chain. Actions can be:

    * **Passive**: Actions like discovering and detecting threats without directly affecting the attacker.
    * **Active**: Actions like denying, disrupting, degrading, deceiving, or destroying the attacker's efforts.


3. **Example**: In a phishing scenario, during the delivery phase, you might:
   * **Detect** suspicious emails.
   * **Deny** by blocking the sender.
   * **Disrupt** by quarantining the email.
   * **Degrade** by stripping attachments.
   * **Deceive** by rerouting emails to a honeypot.
