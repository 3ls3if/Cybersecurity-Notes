# Public Data Sources

## Public Data Sources

1.  **Public Threat Intelligence Sources**:

    * These are freely available to anyone and usually have no cost associated with access.
    * Types include threat bulletins, feeds, and platforms.


2.  **Challenges**:

    * **Trustworthiness**: Public sources often have uncurated indicators, leading to noise and false positives.
    * **Lack of Context**: Indicators like IPs, hashes, or domains may lack detailed context about their roles in malicious activities.
    * **Outdated Data**: Some sources keep old data, making validation harder and potentially wasting time on irrelevant alerts.


3. **Examples of Public Threat Intelligence Feeds**:
   * **Cybercrime Tracker**: Provides URLs and IPs associated with malicious activities.
   * **URLhaus**: Shares malicious URLs used for malware distribution.
   * **Ransomware Tracker**: Tracks ransomware-related domains, IPs, and URLs.
   * **OpenPhish**: Offers feeds on phishing campaigns.
   * **I-Blocklist**: Maintains lists of IP addresses related to various categories like web attacks and proxies.
   * **Cyber Cure Platform**: Provides lists of infected IPs, malware URLs, and hash files.\

4. **Feed Aggregators**:
   * **LIMO**: Aggregates multiple threat intelligence feeds and is compatible with STIX and TAXII protocols.
   * **Hail A TAXII**: Another feed aggregator that collects open-source threat intelligence feeds in STIX format.

## Threat Intelligence Platforms

1. **Public Threat Intelligence Platforms**:
   * These platforms organize multiple threat intelligence feeds into a single stream, making it easier to manage and utilize the data.
   * They can be used for enrichment, adding more context to existing data.\

2. **Examples of Public Threat Intelligence Platforms**:
   * **STAXX by Anomali**: A platform that aggregates threat intelligence feeds.
   * **MISP**: An open-source threat intelligence platform.
   * **CRITs**: Another open-source platform for threat intelligence.
   * **OTX (Open Threat Exchange) by Alien Labs**: A community-driven platform for sharing threat intelligence.
   * **OpenCTI**: An open-source platform for managing cyber threat intelligence.
   * **CIF (Collective Intelligence Framework) by CSIRT Gadget**: A platform for sharing and managing threat intelligence.\

3.  **Benefits**:

    * **Enrichment**: These platforms can add valuable context to threat data, making it more actionable.
    * **Aggregation**: They combine multiple feeds into a single stream, simplifying data management.
    * **Accessibility**: Many of these platforms are available for free, making them accessible to organizations of all sizes.


4. **Challenges**:
   * **Trustworthiness**: Public threat intelligence sources may have uncurated indicators, leading to noise and false positives.
   * **Maintenance**: Some platforms may require significant effort to maintain and keep up-to-date.
