# Private Data Sources

## Private Data Sources

1. **Private Data Sources**:
   * These are threat intelligence sources available through paid subscriptions. They are provided by various vendors, including traditional security service providers and specialized threat intelligence vendors.\

2. **Types of Private Data Sources**:
   * **Narrative-Based Reports**:
     * Also known as finished intelligence, these reports provide detailed descriptions of events related to intrusions or incidents.
     * They include TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), campaign investigations, and sometimes attribution.
     * Advantages: Rich in detail, full of indicators, and provide a comprehensive picture of threats.
     * Disadvantages: Time-consuming to produce, difficult to make actionable, and require custom tools for processing.
     * Examples of vendors: FireEye, Kaspersky, Recorded Future, Flashpoint, Intel 471.\

   * **Threat Intelligence Feeds**:
     * Real-time and continuous streams of data providing information on potential cyber threats and risks.
     * Include simple indicators like malware hashes, suspicious domains, or IPs associated with malicious activities.
     * Advantages: Actionable, easy to integrate, up-to-date, and vetted information.
     * Disadvantages: Lack context compared to reports, come in large volumes, and sometimes lack relevance.
     * Examples of vendors: Recorded Future, Malware Patrol, I-Blocklist, TruSTAR, IBM X-Force, Anomali.\

3. **Relevance and Quality**:
   * The relevance of threat intelligence is crucial. Intelligence that is not relevant to your organizationâ€™s threat model is useless.
   * Quality can be subjective and depends on factors like the sector, technologies used, location, and size of the company.
   * It is recommended to define your own use cases and requirements before looking for threat intelligence solutions.\

    * **Indicators with Context**: They offer actionable intelligence with context.
    * **Enrichment**: Useful for adding more information to existing data.
    * **Aggregation**: Combine multiple feeds and sometimes include narrative-based reports.
