# OSINT

## Open Source Intelligence

1. **What is OSINT?**
   * **Definition**: Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is derived from publicly available information that is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to address specific intelligence requirements.\

2.  **Advantages of OSINT**:

    * **Cost-Effective**: Mostly free to use.
    * **Wide Availability**: Offers unlimited potential on any topic.
    * **Up-to-Date**: Generally current and can be shared with anyone.


3. **Disadvantages of OSINT**:
   * **Disinformation Risk**: Information might be inaccurate or misleading.
   * **Volume of Data**: Identifying relevant and reliable sources can be challenging due to the vast amount of publicly available information.\

4. **Uses of OSINT**:
   * **For Threat Actors**: They use OSINT to identify potential targets and exploit weaknesses.
   * **For Security Professionals**:
     * Identify the organization's exposed attack surface (e.g., public IP ranges, open ports, company domains).
     * Collect information about adversaries (e.g., monitoring threat actor communications).\

5. **Examples of OSINT Tools**:
   * **OSINT Framework**: A collection of OSINT tools categorized by types of information (e.g., username, email address, domain name).
   * **Shodan, Censys, Binary Edge**: Search engines that find publicly available devices like webcams, routers, and servers.

## OSINT Types

1. **Credential Monitoring**:
   * **Tools**: Use tools like Have I Been Pwned, GhostProject, and DeHashed to check if your email or credentials have been compromised in breaches.
   * **Action**: Regularly monitor these platforms and update your passwords if your credentials are found.\

2.  **Google Dorks**:

    * **Definition**: Advanced search queries that use specific operators to find information not readily available on websites.
    * **Example**: `searchterm site:example.com filetype:pdf` to find PDF files containing a search term on a specific website.
    * **Use Case**: Searching for terms like "password" on public platforms like Trello to find exposed sensitive information.


3.  **Recommendations**:

    * **Reset Credentials**: If you've shared credentials publicly, reset them immediately.
    * **Privacy Settings**: Set documents and boards on platforms like Trello, JIRA, and GitHub to private.
    * **Protect Assets**: Secure publicly exposed assets like routers and databases to prevent unauthorized access.\
