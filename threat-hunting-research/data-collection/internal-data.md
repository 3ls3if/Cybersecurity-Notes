# Internal Data

## Internal Data Acquisition

1. **Internal Data Sources:**
   * **Host Data (Endpoint Data)**: This includes data from devices like mobile phones, laptops, desktop PCs, and servers. Key types of host data are:
     * **Process Execution Metadata**: Information on processes running on endpoints.
     * **Registry Access Data**: Data related to registry objects on Windows-based endpoints.
     * **File Data**: Information on file creation/modification dates, size, type, and location.
     * **Network Data**: Parent process information for network connections.\

2.  **Network Data**:

    * **Firewall Logs**: Information on network traffic at the network's border.
    * **Proxy Logs**: HTTP data on outgoing web requests.
    * **DNS Logs**: Data on domain name server resolution, including domain to IP address mapping.
    * **Web Server Logs**: Records of user requests processed by the server.
    * **Authentication Server Logs**: Logs of sign-in failures, successful logins, and invalid requests.


3. **Threat Intelligence Data**:
   * **Internal Threat Intelligence**: Leveraging intelligence from your own network, especially during campaign analysis.
   * **Historical Knowledge**: Maintaining historical data from past investigations to enhance threat awareness.

## Why is this important:

* **Context Building**: Understanding internal data sources helps in building context during incident investigations.
* **Detection and Prevention**: By leveraging threat data from your own network, you can detect and stop threats more effectively.
* **Collaboration**: Threat intelligence analysts need to know what data to request from other teams to build a comprehensive analysis.\
