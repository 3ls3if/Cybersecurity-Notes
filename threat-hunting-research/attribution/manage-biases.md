# Manage Biases

## Manage Biases

* **Avoid Time Pressure:** Making decisions under time pressure can worsen judgment. Try to allocate enough time for important decisions.
* **Avoid Multitasking:** Focus on one task at a time to improve the quality of your thinking and decisions.
* **Think Statistically:** Train yourself to think in terms of probabilities and statistics, as humans tend to misjudge probabilities intuitively.
* **Peer Review:** Always review your findings with peers. They can spot gaps or errors you might have missed.
