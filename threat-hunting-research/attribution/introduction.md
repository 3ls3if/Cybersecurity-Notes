# Introduction

## Attribution

* **What is Attribution?**\
  Attribution in cybersecurity is about identifying who is behind a cyber attack. This can be challenging due to techniques like false flags and file-less threats that attackers use to hide their identity.\

*   **Types of Attribution:**

    * **True Attribution:** Identifying the actual individuals or groups responsible for an attack. This can include nation-states acting in their government's interest.
    * **Campaign Attribution:** Linking multiple attacks to a specific group based on common indicators. This helps in understanding the attack patterns and motivations.


* **Why Attribution Matters:**
  * **Tools Level:** Knowing the attacker can help predict the tools they might use.
  * **Tactics Level:** Understanding how attackers operate during an attack.
  * **Operations Level:** Recognizing long-term patterns of behavior.
  * **Strategy Level:** Helping management and policymakers make informed decisions.
  * **Policy Level:** Assisting in comprehensive threat management and policy decisions.\
