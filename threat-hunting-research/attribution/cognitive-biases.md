# Cognitive Biases

## Cognitive Biases

* **Cognitive Biases:** These are tendencies to favor certain perspectives or outcomes based on past experiences, environment, and cognitive abilities. They can influence decisions and business outcomes in cybersecurity.\

* **Types of Cognitive Biases:**
  * **Availability Bias:** Relying on immediate examples that come to mind. For instance, if recent news focuses on ransomware, analysts might overestimate its risk.
  * **Confirmation Bias:** Seeking information that confirms pre-existing beliefs while ignoring opposing data. This can lead to biased investigations.
  * **Correlation is Not Causation:** Assuming that because two events occur together, one causes the other. It's important to look for evidence of causation, not just correlation.
  * **Anchoring Effect:** Focusing too heavily on the first piece of information encountered. For example, an initial price point in negotiations can anchor further discussions.
  * **Illusory Correlation:** Perceiving a relationship between variables when none exists. The brain tends to find patterns even when there are none.
  * **Framing Effect:** Decisions are influenced by how information is presented. For example, emphasizing that "one in five companies never got their data back after a ransomware attack" can lead to buying expensive security tools for low-probability risks.\
