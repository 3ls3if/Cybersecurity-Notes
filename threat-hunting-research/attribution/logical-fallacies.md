# Logical Fallacies

## Logical Fallacies

* **What is a Fallacy?**\
  A fallacy is an error in reasoning that weakens an argument. It can be unintentional or used intentionally to deceive.\

* **Types of Fallacies:**
  *   **Formal Fallacies:** These are errors in the logical structure of an argument. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion does not logically follow.\


      * **Example:** Appeal to probability – Assuming something is true just because it might be possible.


  * **Informal Fallacies:** These are errors in reasoning due to the content or context of the argument.
    * **Example:** Burden of proof – Claiming something is true just because it hasn't been proven false.\

* **Common Examples:**
  * **Anecdotal Evidence Fallacy (Formal):** Using personal experiences instead of logical evidence.
    * **Example:** "One client doubled conversions by changing text color, so it must work for everyone."
  * **Argument by Repetition (Informal):** Repeating an argument without providing new evidence.
    * **Example:** "This is wrong." "No, it isn't." "Yes, it is." (repeatedly without new support)\
