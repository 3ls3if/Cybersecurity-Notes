# Automated: Wifite

## What is Wifite

Wifite is a wireless auditing tool developed by Derv82 and maintained by kimocoder. You can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/kimocoder/wifite2). In the latest Kali Linux, it comes pre-installed. Itâ€™s a great alternative to the more tedious to use wireless auditing tools and provides simple CLI to interact and perform wireless attacks. It has great features like 5GHz support, Pixie Dust attack, WPA/WPA2 handshake capture attack and PMKID attack as well.
