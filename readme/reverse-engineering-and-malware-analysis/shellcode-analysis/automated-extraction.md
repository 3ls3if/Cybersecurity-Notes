# Automated Extraction

## Introduction

The **`mal_unpack`** tool by Hasherezade is a highly specialized utility designed to automate the extraction of malicious payloads (like shellcode or malware) from packed or obfuscated executables. It simplifies the process of unpacking, which is often necessary during malware analysis, especially when dealing with modern malware employing packing or encryption to hide its actual payload.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/hasherezade/mal_unpack.git
cd mal_unpack

mal_unpack.exe /exe <path_to_the_malware> /timeout <timeout: ms>
```
