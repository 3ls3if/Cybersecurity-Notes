# Malware Analysis Tools

## Malware Analysis Tools

1.  **Binary Analysis Tools**:

    * **Purpose**: Parse files and extract information.
    * **Example**: Hex editors that read the binary information of files, such as identifying file types by their magic header bytes (e.g., MZ for Microsoft executable files).


2.  **Disassemblers and Decompilers**:

    * **Disassemblers**: View low-level code of a program, requiring knowledge of assembly language.
    * **Decompilers**: Attempt to restore high-level source code from low-level code. Tools like IDA Pro or Ghidra often bundle both.


3. **Debuggers**:
   * **Purpose**: Execute code line by line to trace through loops, examine conditional statements, and view API execution.
   * **Use Case**: Part of dynamic analysis, usually done in an enclosed environment to avoid compromising production systems.\

4.  **Monitoring Tools**:

    * **Purpose**: Monitor system behaviors such as file system modifications, registry changes, memory usage, and network interactions.
    * **Function**: Tap into the Windows system using APIs to log information for review and simulation.
