# Identity Based Policies

## Introduction

Identity-Based Policies in AWS IAM are attached directly to _IAM identities such as users, groups, or roles_. These policies define what actions are allowed or denied for the associated identity. Identity-Based Policies are used to manage permissions for individual users or groups within your AWS account. They grant or restrict access to AWS resources based on the identity of the user or group.
