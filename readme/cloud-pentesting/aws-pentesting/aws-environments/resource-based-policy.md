# Resource Based Policy

## Resource Based Policy

Resource-Based Policies are attached directly to _AWS resources such as S3 buckets, Lambda functions, or SNS topics_. These policies define what actions are allowed or denied for other AWS identities or services trying to access the resource. Resource-Based Policies are used to manage permissions for the resource itself, controlling who can access and perform actions on the resource. They provide more granular control over resource-level access and can be used to enable cross-account access or integrate with other AWS services.
