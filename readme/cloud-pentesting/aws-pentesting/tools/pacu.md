# Pacu

## Introduction

With the continued proliferation of Amazon Web Services (AWS), companies are continuing to move their technical assets to the cloud. With this paradigm shift comes new security challenges for both Sysadmin and DevOps teams.  These aren’t just problems for the security-unaware, either.  Even large enterprises – such as GoDaddy and Uber – have had major breaches from AWS configuration flaws.

This is where an authenticated AWS penetration test can help.  By simulating a breach and providing an attacker with a set of ‘compromised’ AWS keys, the range of AWS services can fully vetted.

Several tools exist to aid in the scanning of AWS vulnerabilities, but focus on compliance requirements, rather than exploit potential.  The offensive security community has a glaring need for a tool that provides a structured, comprehensive approach to pentesting AWS.
