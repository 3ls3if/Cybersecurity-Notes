# Public Access

## Public Accessibility of Resources

### Theory

* Misconfiguration of resources can can allow public exposure
* Examples:
  * Public S3 buckets leaking sensitive data
  * Insecure webapps or functions exposed externally
  * Database services with weak creds
* Can lead to the compromise of:
  * Sensitive data
  * Access Keys
  * Underlying server infrastructure
