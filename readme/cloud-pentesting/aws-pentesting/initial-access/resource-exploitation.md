# Resource Exploitation

## Resource Exploitation

### Theory

* Deployed resources (EC2, Lambda functions, Webapps, etc.) are at risk of having vulnerabilities
  * Unpatched software with known vulns
  * Weak authentication
  * SQL or command injection vulns
  * Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
* Exploitation of resources can lead to remote access but also roles in AWS
