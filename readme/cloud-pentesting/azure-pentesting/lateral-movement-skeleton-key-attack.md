# Lateral Movement - Skeleton Key Attack

## Introduction

The **Skeleton Key attack** is a sophisticated technique that allows attackers to **bypass Active Directory authentication** by **injecting a master password** into the domain controller. This enables the attacker to **authenticate as any user** without their password, effectively **granting them unrestricted access** to the domain.

It can be performed using [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz). To carry out this attack, **Domain Admin rights are prerequisite**, and the attacker must target each domain controller to ensure a comprehensive breach. However, the attack's effect is temporary, as **restarting the domain controller eradicates the malware**, necessitating a reimplementation for sustained access.

**Executing the attack** requires a single command: `misc::skeleton`.

## Prerequisities

* Attacker must have obtained Domain Admin rights
* Mimikatz running on a Domain Controller
* For most effective use all Domain Controllers will need to be exploited however, this is not a hard requirement
* Rebooting a Domain Controller will remove the malware

## Practical

### Mimikatz

After Mimikatz has been dropped onto a Domain Controller and executed with Domain Admin privileges the following simple command can be used to perform the exploit.

```
privilege::debug #Check for '20' OK debug rights.
misc::skeleton
```
