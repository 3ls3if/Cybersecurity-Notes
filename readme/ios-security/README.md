# üçé iOS Security

### The iOS Platform

Apple‚Äôs mobile operating system iOS in Q1 2017 held second place in the mobile OS landscape, with 14.7 percent market share, per IDC‚Äôs Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.11 iOS runs on several Apple devices, including iPhone, iPad, and iPod. Unlike Android‚Äôs open philosophy, iOS is used only on Apple products, which ensures a more tightly controlled ecosystem. Due to this and aggressive iOS application reviews, the Apple application store has very little malicious software present, and anything suspicious or remotely suspicious of violating Apple‚Äôs policy gets flagged and removed from the store. However, there are still commercially available spyware tools targeting iOS, such as the infamous Pegasus spyware, which used three different vulnerabilities to compromise the iPhone‚Äôs security and spy on infected users.
