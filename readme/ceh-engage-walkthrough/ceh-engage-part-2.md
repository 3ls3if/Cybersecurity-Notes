CEHORG suspects a possible sniffing attack on a machine in its network. The organization has retained the network traffic data for the session and stored it in the Documents folder in EH Workstation – 2 (Windows 11) machine as sniffsession.pcap. You have been assigned a task to analyze and find out the protocol used for sniffing on its network.

An attacker has created a custom UDP packet and sent it to one of the machines in the CEHORG. You have been given a task to study the ""CustomUDP.pcapng"" file and find the data size of the UDP packet (in bytes). Note: The CustomUDP.pcapng file is located at C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\ in the Documents folder on EH Workstation – 2 (Windows 11) machine.

A disgruntled employee in CEHORG has used the Covert\_TCP utility to share a secret message with another user in the CEHORG network. Covert\_TCP manipulates the TCP/IP header of the data packets to send a file one byte at a time from any host to a destination. It can be used to hide the data inside IP header fields. The employee used the IP ID field to hide the message. The network capture file “Capture.pcapng” has been retained in the “C:\Users\Administrator\Documents” directory of the “EH Workstation – 2” machine. Analyze the session to get the message that was transmitted.
