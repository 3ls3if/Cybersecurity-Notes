# NoSQL Databases

## NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases store and retrieve data in a format other than traditional SQL relational tables. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. As such they typically have fewer relational constraints and consistency checks than SQL, and claim significant benefits in terms of scalability, flexibility, and performance.

Like SQL databases, users interact with data in NoSQL databases using queries that are passed by the application to the database. However, different NoSQL databases use a wide range of query languages instead of a universal standard like SQL (Structured Query Language). This may be a custom query language or a common language like XML or JSON.

## NoSQL database models

There is a wide variety of NoSQL databases. In order to detect vulnerabilities in a NoSQL database, it helps to understand the model framework and language.

Some common types of NoSQL databases include:

* Document stores - These store data in flexible, semi-structured documents. They typically use formats such as JSON, BSON, and XML, and are queried in an API or query language. Examples include MongoDB and Couchbase.
* Key-value stores - These store data in a key-value format. Each data field is associated with a unique key string. Values are retrieved based on the unique key. Examples include Redis and Amazon DynamoDB.
* Wide-column stores - These organize related data into flexible column families rather than traditional rows. Examples include Apache Cassandra and Apache HBase.
* Graph databases - These use nodes to store data entities, and edges to store relationships between entities. Examples include Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.
