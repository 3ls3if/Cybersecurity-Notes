# üèá Race Conditions

## What is Race Conditions

A race condition is a software vulnerability that occurs when multiple threads or processes access shared resources concurrently, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.

Race conditions are a common type of vulnerability closely related to business [logic flaws](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws). They occur when websites process requests concurrently without adequate safeguards. This can lead to multiple distinct threads interacting with the same data at the same time, resulting in a "collision" that causes unintended behavior in the application. A race condition attack uses carefully timed requests to cause intentional collisions and exploit this unintended behavior for malicious purposes.

The period of time during which a collision is possible is known as the "race window". This could be the fraction of a second between two interactions with the database, for example.

Like other logic flaws, the impact of a race condition is heavily dependent on the application and the specific functionality in which it occurs.
