# Limit overrun race conditions

## Limit Overrun Race Conditions

The most well-known type of race condition enables you to exceed some kind of limit imposed by the business logic of the application.



There are many variations of this kind of attack, including:

* Redeeming a gift card multiple times
* Rating a product multiple times
* Withdrawing or transferring cash in excess of your account balance
* Reusing a single CAPTCHA solution
* Bypassing an anti-brute-force rate limit



Limit overruns are a subtype of so-called "time-of-check to time-of-use" (TOCTOU) flaws.



## Detecting and Exploiting Limit Overrun (Repeater)

The process of detecting and exploiting limit overrun race conditions is relatively simple. In high-level terms, all you need to do is:

1. Identify a single-use or rate-limited endpoint that has some kind of security impact or other useful purpose.
2. Issue multiple requests to this endpoint in quick succession to see if you can overrun this limit.

### Sending a Group of Requests (Repeater)

* Right click the request and send it to repeater
* In the repeater tab right click the request and agin send it to repater or you can use ctrl+r (You have to create 15 to 20 requests)
* Now, click on the + icon besides the last request tab
* Select Create tab group
* Select all the requests
* Give it a name
* Select a color
* Click on Create
* Expand the send button&#x20;
* Select Send group in parallel option
* Click on the Send group (parallel button)



## Bypassing Rate Limits (Anti Bruteforce Mechanism)

* Send the login request to the intruder
* Set the payload position to password field
* In the payloads tab enter some default passwords
* Switch to the Resource pool tab
* Select Custom resource pool option&#x20;
* Click on Start attack button
* Look for the 302 response
