# Lab: Bypassing GraphQL brute force protections

The user login mechanism for this lab is powered by a GraphQL API. The API endpoint has a rate limiter that returns an error if it receives too many requests from the same origin in a short space of time.

To solve the lab, brute force the login mechanism to sign in as `carlos`. Use the list of [authentication lab passwords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords) as your password source.

{% hint style="info" %}
This lab requires you to craft a large request that uses aliases to send multiple login attempts at the same time. As this request could be time-consuming to create manually, we recommend you use a script to build the request.

The below example JavaScript builds a list of aliases corresponding to our list of authentication lab passwords and copies the request to your clipboard. To run this script:

1. Open the lab in Burp's browser.
2. Right-click the page and select **Inspect**.
3. Select the **Console** tab.
4. Paste the script and press Enter.

You can then use the generated aliases when crafting your request in Repeater.
{% endhint %}

```

        success
    }
`.replaceAll('$index',index).replaceAll('$password',element)).join('\n'));console.log("The query has been copied to your clipboard.");

```



## Steps

* Open Burp Suite and visit the target website
* Send the POST /graphql/v1 Login request to the repeater
* In the browser window copy the javascript code that is given in the hint section and execute
* Go to the Repeater tab and paste the copied payload inside mutation section
* Send the request&#x20;
* In the response tab search for the value true in the bottom search bar
* We can see the brute force index which we can now see the bruteforce index in the request tab to view the password of Carlos
* Login using Carlos user to solve the lab.
