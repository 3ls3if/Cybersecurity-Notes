# Bypassing rate limiting using aliases

Ordinarily, GraphQL objects can't contain multiple properties with the same name. Aliases enable you to bypass this restriction by explicitly naming the properties you want the API to return. You can use aliases to return multiple instances of the same type of object in one request.

The simplified example below shows a series of aliased queries checking whether store discount codes are valid. This operation could potentially bypass rate limiting as it is a single HTTP request, even though it could potentially be used to check a vast number of discount codes at once.

```
 #Request with aliased queries

    query isValidDiscount($code: Int) {
        isvalidDiscount(code:$code){
            valid
        }
        isValidDiscount2:isValidDiscount(code:$code){
            valid
        }
        isValidDiscount3:isValidDiscount(code:$code){
            valid
        }
    }
```
