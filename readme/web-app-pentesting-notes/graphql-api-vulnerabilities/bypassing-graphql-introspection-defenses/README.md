# Bypassing GraphQL introspection defenses

## Methods to Bypass

* Try inserting a special character after the `__schema` keyword.
* Try characters like spaces, new lines and commas, as they are ignored by GraphQL but not by flawed regex.
* if the developer has only excluded `__schema{`, then the below introspection query would not be excluded.

```
 #Introspection query with newline

    {
        "query": "query{__schema
        {queryType{name}}}"
    }
```

* Try a GET request, or a POST request with a content-type of `x-www-form-urlencoded`.
* The example below shows an introspection probe sent via GET, with URL-encoded parameters.

```
    # Introspection probe as GET request

    GET /graphql?query=query%7B__schema%0A%7BqueryType%7Bname%7D%7D%7D
```
