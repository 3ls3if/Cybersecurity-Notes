# Lab: Performing CSRF exploits over GraphQL

The user management functions for this lab are powered by a GraphQL endpoint. The endpoint accepts requests with a content-type of `x-www-form-urlencoded` and is therefore vulnerable to [cross-site request forgery](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) (CSRF) attacks.

To solve the lab, craft some HTML that uses a [CSRF attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) to change the viewer's email address, then upload it to your exploit server.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`.
