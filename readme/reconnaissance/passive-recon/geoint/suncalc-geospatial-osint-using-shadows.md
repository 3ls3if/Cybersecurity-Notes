# SunCalc - Geospatial OSINT using shadows

## Introduction

Using **geospatial OSINT** (Open Source Intelligence) with [**SunCalc**](https://www.suncalc.org/#/27.6936,-97.5195,3/2024.11.06/15:15/1/3) can provide valuable information about a location based on sunlight and shadow patterns. [**SunCalc**](https://www.suncalc.org/#/27.6936,-97.5195,3/2024.11.06/15:15/1/3) is a JavaScript library (and also available as a web tool) that calculates the sun’s position and phases for a specific time and place. This data can aid in geospatial analysis, especially when combined with satellite imagery, street views, and other geospatial data sources.

## Uses of [SunCalc](https://www.suncalc.org/#/27.6936,-97.5195,3/2024.11.06/15:15/1/3)

* Determine Sun Position at a Specific Location and Time
* Verify the Time of Imagery Using Shadows
* Calculate Sunrise, Sunset, and Twilight Times
* Plan Surveillance or Site Visits with Lighting in Mind
* Use in Conjunction with Map Data and Satellite Imagery

## Example Workflow for Geospatial OSINT with [SunCalc](https://chatgpt.com/c/672b3b00-9d34-8005-be00-a7bf26f9fb09)

* **Identify the Coordinates:** Gather the exact coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the location you’re investigating.
* **Set the Date and Time:** Use SunCalc to input the specific date and time to get the sun’s position.
* **Calculate Shadow Direction and Length:** From the sun’s altitude and azimuth, determine where shadows should fall at that time.
* **Analyze Images or Videos:** Use the calculated shadow direction to check if shadows in images or videos align with SunCalc’s predictions.
* **Compare with Other Sources:** Cross-reference findings with map or satellite imagery to confirm location details and improve the accuracy of your analysis.
