# Geotagging: GeoSocial Footprint

## GeoSocial Fooprint

A geosocial footprint is the combined bits of location information that a user divulges through social media, which ultimately forms the users location "footprint". For Twitter.com users, this footprint is created from GPS enabled tweets, social check-ins, natural language location searching (geocoding), and profile harvesting.
