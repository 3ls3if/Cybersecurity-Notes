## Russian Ukranine Monitor Map

The [Centre for Information Resilience](https://twitter.com/cen4infores), alongside [Bellingcat](https://twitter.com/bellingcat) and [GeoConfirmed](https://twitter.com/GeoConfirmed), have been collecting, verifying and sharing geolocated data on Russian military activities in and around Ukraine on an online map entitled “[Russia-Ukraine Monitor Map](https://maphub.net/Cen4infoRes/russian-ukraine-monitor)” since January 2022. As of December 2022, the map has been moved to [EyesOnRussia.org](https://eyesonrussia.org/).&#x20;

## Railway Station Webcams

[railwebcams.net](https://railwebcams.net/), a website dedicated to “_railroad, trams and station webcams worldwide_“.\
At the top of the website I chose “_Rail Webcams By Country_” and then selected Russia from the list.
