# Phone Numbers

## Phone Number OSINT

Telephone OSINT can be tricky as there are not that many open databases. You need to use various techniques and tradecraft. Apps like Truecaller, Whatsapp will take a number and add to their dataset, so you need to be comfortable with that risk. Always remember if you use exfiltrated data as a way of checking a number, the date the telephone number was exfiltrated is key, as these datasets can be years old. Don't forget some sites allow you to keyword search and this is another method of finding Telephone numbers.
