# Mitaka - In-Browser Tool

## Introduction

[Web browser extensions](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/top-10-browser-extensions-for-hackers-osint-researchers-0195468/) are one of the simplest ways to get starting using open-source intelligence tools because they're cross-platform. So anyone using Chrome on Linux, macOS, and Windows can use them all the same. The same goes for Firefox. One desktop browser add-on, in particular, makes OSINT as easy as right-clicking to search for hashes, email addresses, and URLs.

Mitaka, created by [Manabu Niseki](https://ninoseki.github.io/about/), works in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Once installed, it lets you select and inspect certain pieces of text and indicators of compromise (IoC), running them through a variety of different search engines, all with just a few clicks. The tool can help investigators identify malware, determine the credibility of an email address, and see if a URL is associated with anything sketchy, to name just a few things.
