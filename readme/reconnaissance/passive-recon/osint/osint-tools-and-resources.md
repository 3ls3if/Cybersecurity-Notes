* Usenet newsgroups, particularly postings from the target's employees looking for help with particular technologies
* LinkedIn, Jigsaw, and other websites that provide employee information
* Job search websites, especially ones for technical positions that provide a list of the technologies and services that must be supported by a successful applicant
* Historic or cached content, retrieved by search engines (cache:url in Google, or WayBack Machine at www.archive.org)
* Country- and language-specific social and business related sites (refer to http://searchenginecolossus.com)
* Sites that aggregate and compare results from multiple search engines, such as Zuula (www.zuula.com)
* Corporate and employee blogs, as well as personal blogs of key employees
* Social networks (LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter)
* Sites that provide lookups of DNS, route, and server information, especially, DNSstuff (www.dnsstuff.com), ServerSniff (www.serversniff.net), Netcraft (www.netcraft.com), and myIPneighbors.com
* Shodan (www.shodanHQ.com), sometimes referred to as the "hacker's Google"; Shodan lists Internet-accessible devices and allows the tester to search for devices with known vulnerabilities
