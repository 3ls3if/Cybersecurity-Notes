# üêπ Stealth Scanning Strategies

When employing stealth to support reconnaissance, a tester mimicking the actions of a hacker will do the following:

* Camouflage tool signatures to avoid detection and triggering an alarm
* Hide the attack within legitimate traffic
* Modify the attack to hide the source and type of traffic
* Make the attack invisible using nonstandard traffic types or encryption

Stealth scanning techniques can include some or all of the following:

* Adjusting source IP stack and tool identification settings
* Modifying packet parameters (nmap)
* Using proxies with anonymity networks (ProxyChains and Tor network)
