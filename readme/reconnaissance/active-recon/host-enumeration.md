{% hint style="info" %}
Run multiple host discovery scans while conducting a penetration test. Certain devices may be time dependent. During one penetration test, it was discovered that the system administrator set up a game server after regular business hours. Because it was not an approved business system, the administrator did not follow the normal process for securing the server; multiple vulnerable services were present, and it had not received necessary security patches. Testers were able to compromise the game server and gain access to the underlying corporate network using vulnerabilities in the administrator's game server.
