# ⛷️ Sparta

## Theory

SPARTA is a python GUI application which simplifies network infrastructure penetration testing by aiding the penetration tester in the scanning and enumeration phase. It allows the tester to save time by having point-and-click access to his toolkit and by displaying all tool output in a convenient way. If little time is spent setting up commands and tools, more time can be spent focusing on analysing results. Despite the automation capabilities, the commands and tools used are fully customisable as each tester has his own methods, habits and preferences.
