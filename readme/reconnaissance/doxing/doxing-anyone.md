# Doxing Anyone

## Introduction

Doxing is the act of finding one's personal information through research and discovery, with little to no information to start with. You may have seen doxing in the news, for instance when not so long ago, hacker team Anonymous doxed and reported thousands of twitter accounts related to ISIS. Doxing can be useful for finding the address of a coworker, or simply investigating people on the internet. The tutorial I will provide to you now will teach you the basics of doxing and how you can protect yourself against malicious people on the internet.
