## SOX

* **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)**: Enacted in 2002 to protect the public from fraudulent practices by corporations, following major financial scandals like Enron and Tyco.
* **Key Requirements**: SOX sets new requirements for US public company boards, management, and public accounting firms to increase transparency and accuracy in financial reporting.
* **Cybersecurity Impact**: SOX helps keep financial data secure from insider threats, cyber attacks, and security breaches through a data security framework with four key pillars: ensuring financial data security, preventing malicious tampering, tracking data breach attempts, and maintaining event logs for auditors.
