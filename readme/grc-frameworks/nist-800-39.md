* **Holistic Risk Management**: NIST 800-39 emphasizes a holistic view of risk management, considering the organizational, business process, and information system tiers.
* **Three-Tiered Approach**: The framework addresses risk management at three levels: organizational, business process, and information system.
* **Beyond Checklist Compliance**: Unlike a checklist approach, NIST 800-39 integrates risk management into the company's culture and processes, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of risks.
