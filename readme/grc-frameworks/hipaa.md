# HIPAA

## HIPAA

* **HIPAA Overview**: HIPAA stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a federal law passed in 1996 to protect sensitive patient health information.
* **Privacy and Security Rules**: The Privacy Rule governs the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI), while the Security Rule protects electronic PHI (ePHI) and requires covered entities to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
* **Compliance and Enforcement**: The HHS Office of Civil Rights enforces HIPAA rules, and while there is no official HIPAA certification, organizations must show a good faith effort towards compliance to avoid penalties.
