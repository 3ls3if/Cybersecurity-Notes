# GDPR

## GDPR

* **GDPR Overview**: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the world's strongest set of data protection rules, enforced across Europe since May 25, 2018, to protect personal information.
* **Personal Data Protection**: GDPR defines personal data broadly and places strict limits on what organizations can do with it, categorizing businesses as controllers or processors with different obligations.
* **Global Relevance**: Although a European law, GDPR applies to businesses outside the EU, including those in the US, making it essential for GRC professionals globally to ensure compliance.
