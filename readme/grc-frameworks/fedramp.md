# FedRAMP

## FedRAMP

* **FedRAMP Overview**: FedRAMP stands for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program. It's a compliance program established by the US government to ensure cloud products and services meet specific security standards.
* **Importance for Cloud Providers**: Any cloud service provider (CSP) wanting to work with the US government must be FedRAMP compliant. This includes major providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, as well as smaller SaaS companies.
* **Compliance Process**: To become FedRAMP compliant, a CSP must undergo an independent security assessment by a third-party assessment organization (3PAO). Successful compliance results in a FedRAMP Authorization to Operate (ATO), which can be obtained through a government agency or the Joint Authorization Board (JAB).
