# ARP

## ARP Poisoning

### Theory

#### ARP

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol that connects a device's IP address to its MAC address in a local area network (LAN). ARP is necessary because computers need to know the IP address and MAC address of a destination before they can start network communication.

#### ARP Poisoning

ARP poisoning, also known as ARP spoofing, is a cyber attack that uses malicious ARP packets to change the IP to MAC address table on a LAN's default gateway.
