# ðŸ˜· Server-side parameter pollution

{% embed url="https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths/api-testing/api-testing-server-side-parameter-pollution/api-testing/server-side-parameter-pollution/server-side-parameter-pollution" %}

Some systems contain internal APIs that aren't directly accessible from the internet. Server-side parameter pollution occurs when a website embeds user input in a server-side request to an internal API without adequate encoding. This means that an attacker may be able to manipulate or inject parameters, which may enable them to, for example:

* Override existing parameters.
* Modify the application behavior.
* Access unauthorized data.

You can test any user input for any kind of parameter pollution. For example, query parameters, form fields, headers, and URL path parameters may all be vulnerable.

**Note**

This vulnerability is sometimes called HTTP parameter pollution. However, this term is also used to refer to a web application firewall (WAF) bypass technique. To avoid confusion, in this topic we'll only refer to server-side parameter pollution.

In addition, despite the similar name, this vulnerability class has very little in common with server-side prototype pollution.
