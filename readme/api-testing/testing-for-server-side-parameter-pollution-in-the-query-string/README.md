## Testing for server-side parameter pollution in the query string

To test for server-side parameter pollution in the query string, place query syntax characters like `#`, `&`, and `=` in your input and observe how the application responds.

Consider a vulnerable application that enables you to search for other users based on their username. When you search for a user, your browser makes the following request:

```
GET /userSearch?name=peter&back=/home
```

To retrieve user information, the server queries an internal API with the following request:

```
GET /users/search?name=peter&publicProfile=true
```

## Truncating query string

You can use a URL-encoded `#` character to attempt to truncate the server-side request. To help you interpret the response, you could also add a string after the `#` character.

For example, you could modify the query string to the following:

```
GET /userSearch?name=peter%23foo&back=/home
```

The front-end will try to access the following URL:

```
GET /users/search?name=peter#foo&publicProfile=true
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

It's essential that you URL-encode the `#` character to %23. Otherwise the front-end application will interpret it as a fragment identifier and it won't be passed to the internal API.
{% endhint %}

Review the response for clues about whether the query has been truncated. For example, if the response returns the user `peter`, the server-side query may have been truncated. If an `Invalid name` error message is returned, the application may have treated `foo` as part of the username. This suggests that the server-side request may not have been truncated.

If you're able to truncate the server-side request, this removes the requirement for the `publicProfile` field to be set to true. You may be able to exploit this to return non-public user profiles.

## Injecting invalid parameters

You can use an URL-encoded `&` character to attempt to add a second parameter to the server-side request.

For example, you could modify the query string to the following:

```
GET /userSearch?name=peter%26foo=xyz&back=/home
```

This results in the following server-side request to the internal API:

```
GET /users/search?name=peter&foo=xyz&publicProfile=true
```

Review the response for clues about how the additional parameter is parsed. For example, if the response is unchanged this may indicate that the parameter was successfully injected but ignored by the application.

To build up a more complete picture, you'll need to test further.

## Injecting valid paramters

If you're able to modify the query string, you can then attempt to add a second valid parameter to the server-side request.

{% hint style="info" %}

For information on how to identify parameters that you can inject into the query string, see the Finding hidden parameters section.
{% endhint %}

For example, if you've identified the `email` parameter, you could add it to the query string as follows:

```
GET /userSearch?name=peter%26email=foo&back=/home
```

This results in the following server-side request to the internal API:

```
GET /users/search?name=peter&email=foo&publicProfile=true
```

Review the response for clues about how the additional parameter is parsed.



***

## Overriding existing parameters

To confirm whether the application is vulnerable to server-side parameter pollution, you could try to override the original parameter. Do this by injecting a second parameter with the same name.

For example, you could modify the query string to the following:

```
GET /userSearch?name=peter%26name=carlos&back=/home
```

This results in the following server-side request to the internal API:

```
GET /users/search?name=peter&name=carlos&publicProfile=true
```

The internal API interprets two `name` parameters. The impact of this depends on how the application processes the second parameter. This varies across different web technologies. For example:

* PHP parses the last parameter only. This would result in a user search for `carlos`.
* ASP.NET combines both parameters. This would result in a user search for `peter,carlos`, which might result in an `Invalid username` error message.
* Node.js / express parses the first parameter only. This would result in a user search for `peter`, giving an unchanged result.

If you're able to override the original parameter, you may be able to conduct an exploit. For example, you could add `name=administrator` to the request. This may enable you to log in as the administrator user.
