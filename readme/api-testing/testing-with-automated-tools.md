# ðŸ‘¨ðŸš€ Testing with automated tools

Burp includes automated tools that can help you detect server-side parameter pollution vulnerabilities.

Burp Scanner automatically detects suspicious input transformations when performing an audit. These occur when an application receives user input, transforms it in some way, then performs further processing on the result. This behavior doesn't necessarily constitute a vulnerability, so you'll need to do further testing using the manual techniques outlined above. For more information, see the Suspicious input transformation issue definition.

You can also use the Backslash Powered Scanner BApp to identify server-side injection vulnerabilities. The scanner classifies inputs as boring, interesting, or vulnerable. You'll need to investigate interesting inputs using the manual techniques outlined above. For more information, see the Backslash Powered Scanning: hunting unknown vulnerability classes whitepaper.
