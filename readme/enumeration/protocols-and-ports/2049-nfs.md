# 2049 - NFS

## Theory

**NFS** is a system designed for **client/server** that enables users to seamlessly access files over a network as though these files were located within a local directory.

A notable aspect of this protocol is its lack of built-in **authentication** or **authorization mechanisms**. Instead, authorization relies on **file system information**, with the server tasked with accurately translating **client-provided user information** into the file system's required **authorization format**, primarily following **UNIX syntax**.

## Practical

### Enumeration

#### Nmap Scripts

```
nfs-ls #List NFS exports and check permissions
nfs-showmount #Like showmount -e
nfs-statfs #Disk statistics and info from NFS share
```

#### Metasploit Modules

```
scanner/nfs/nfsmount #Scan NFS mounts and list permissions
```

### Mounting a Share

```
showmount -e <IP>

mkdir /mnt/new_back
mount -t nfs [-o vers=2] 10.12.0.150:/backup /mnt/new_back -o nolock
```
