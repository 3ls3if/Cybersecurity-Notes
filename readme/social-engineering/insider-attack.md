# üßë‚Äçüíº Insider Attack

## Tools & Preparation

* You should arrive prepared with everything you need to conduct your attack since you may not have an opportunity to download anything from the outside once you‚Äôre in.
* Have all the tools you are likely to need with you on removable media such as a USB drive or CD.
*   In the most difficult cases, such as a fully locked CMOS

    and full disk encryption, you may even want to bring a hard drive with a prepared operating system on it so that you can attempt to gain access to the subject network from

    the provided equipment.

## Orientation

The most common configuration you‚Äôll encounter is the Windows workstation, a stand- alone PC or laptop computer running a version of Microsoft Windows. It will most likely be connected to a wired LAN and utilize the Windows domain login. You‚Äôll be given a domain account. Log in and have a look around. Take some time to ‚Äúbrowse‚Äù the network using the Windows file explorer. You may see several Windows domains as well as drives mapped to file servers, some of which you may already be connected to. The whole point of the insider attack is to find sensitive information, so keep your eyes open for servers with descriptive names such as ‚ÄúHR‚Äù or ‚ÄúEngineering.‚Äù Once you feel comfortable that you know the bounds of your account and have a general view of the network, it‚Äôs time to start elevating your privilege level.
