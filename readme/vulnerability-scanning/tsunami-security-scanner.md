# â›µ Tsunami Security Scanner

## Introduction

Tsunami is a general purpose network security scanner with an extensible plugin system for detecting high severity vulnerabilities with high confidence.

To learn more about Tsunami, visit the official [documentation](https://google.github.io/tsunami-security-scanner/).

Tsunami relies heavily on its plugin system to provide basic scanning capabilities. All publicly available Tsunami plugins are hosted in a separate [google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins](https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins) repository.

## Quick Start

To quickly get started with Tsunami scans,

#### Traditional install

1.  install the following required dependencies:

    ```
    nmap >= 7.80
    ncrack >= 0.7
    ```
2.  start a vulnerable application that can be identified by Tsunami, e.g. an unauthenticated Jupyter Notebook server. The easiest way is to use a docker image:

    ```
    docker run --name unauthenticated-jupyter-notebook -p 8888:8888 -d jupyter/base-notebook start-notebook.sh --NotebookApp.token=''
    ```
3.  execute the following command:

    ```
    bash -c "$(curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner/master/quick_start.sh)"
    ```

The `quick_start.sh` script performs the following tasks:

1. Clone the [google/tsunami-security-scanner](https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner) and [google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins](https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins) repos into `$HOME/tsunami/repos` directory.
2. Compile all [Google Tsunami plugins](https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins/tree/master/google) and move all plugin `jar` files into `$HOME/tsunami/plugins` directory.
3. Compile the Tsunami scanner Fat Jar file and move it into `$HOME/tsunami` directory.
4. Move the `tsunami.yaml` example config into `$HOME/tsunami` directory.
5. Print example Tsunami command for scanning `127.0.0.1` using the previously generated artifacts.
