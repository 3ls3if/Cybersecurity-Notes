# LDAP (Post)

## Theory

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open, vendor-neutral protocol for accessing and maintaining directory information services over an Internet Protocol network. It's a lightweight version of Directory Access Protocol (DAP), which is part of X.500, a standard for directory services. LDAP is the core protocol used in Microsoft's Active Directory (AD) directory service.
