# ðŸŒ‰ Bad Randomness

## Blockhash Example

Letâ€™s start out taking a look at a simple example of using a blockhash value with a blocknumber value. While a hash of a block might seem like a good idea as a random number there are numerous issues with it. Firstly, a blocknumber is a known value set by a miner that persists for a set length of time and can be queried and used in an attackerâ€™s similar algorithm to produce the same result and bypass controls. But there is also an underlying vulnerability to this approach when coupled with a blockchash which we will take a look at below.

**Action Steps:**

> 1\.  Open up your terminal and launch ganache-cli
>
> 2\.  Type out the code below into Remix
>
> 3\.  Within the Deploy Environment section dropdown change the JavaScript VM to the web3 Provider option.
>
> 4\.  Deploy the contract to ganache with the deploy button in Remix

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.6;

contract simpleVulnerableBlockHash {
  uint32 public block_number;
  bytes32 public checkHash;
 
  function get_block_number() public  {   
    block_number = uint32(block.number);
  }
 
  function check_hash() public{
     checkHash = bytes32(blockhash(block_number));
     
  }
 
  function wasteTime() public{
     uint test = uint(block.number);
  }
 
}
```
{% endcode %}

The simple contract above is querying for the current block number in the get\_block\_number function on line 7 and storing it within a block\_number variable created on line 4.  This is the current block number running on the blockchain.

Then we have a function on line 11 which takes the block number and uses it with the blockhash button to retrieve the blockhash and store it in the myHash variable.

## Blockhash Vulnerability

**Action Steps:**

> 1\.  Execute the get\_block\_number function
>
> 2\.  Execute the set\_hash function
>
> 3\.  Check the block\_number value
>
> 4\.  Check the myHash value
>
> 5\.  Execute the wasteTime function 256 times
>
> 6\.  Execute the set\_hash function
>
> 7\.  Check your myHash Value
>
> 8\.  What happened and what implications would this have on calculations your using this value with?
