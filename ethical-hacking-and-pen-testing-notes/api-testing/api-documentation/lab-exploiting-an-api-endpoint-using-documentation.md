# ⚗ Lab: Exploiting an API endpoint using documentation

To solve the lab, find the exposed API documentation and delete `carlos`. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Required knowledge**

To solve this lab, you'll need to know:

* What API documentation is.
* How API documentation may be useful to an attacker.
* How to discover API documentation.

These points are covered in our API Testing Academy topic.
{% endhint %}

### STEP ONE:

* Login using username as wiener and password as peter
* Update wiener's email address and send the request to burp repeater
* In the repeater change the PATCH method to DELETE and change the path /api/user/wiener to /api/user/carlos

* Send the request and as you can see in the below image the user carlos has been deleted.

### STEPS TWO:

* Login using username as wiener and password as peter
* Update the email address
* In **Proxy > HTTP history**, right-click the `PATCH /api/user/wiener` request and select **Send to Repeater**.
* Go to the **Repeater** tab. Send the `PATCH /api/user/wiener` request. Notice that this retrieves credentials for the user `wiener`.
* Remove `/wiener` from the path of the request, so the endpoint is now `/api/user`, then send the request. Notice that this returns an error because there is no user identifier.
* Remove `/user` from the path of the request, so the endpoint is now `/api`, then send the request. Notice that this retrieves API documentation.
* Right-click the response and select **Show response in browser**. Copy the URL.
* Paste the URL into Burp's browser to access the documentation. Notice that the documentation is interactive.
* To delete Carlos and solve the lab, click on the `DELETE` row, enter `carlos`, then click **Send request**.
