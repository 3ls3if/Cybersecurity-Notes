# ⚗ Lab: Exploiting a mass assignment vulnerability

To solve the lab, find and exploit a mass assignment vulnerability to buy a **Lightweight l33t Leather Jacket**. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Required knowledge**

To solve this lab, you'll need to know:

* What mass assignment is.
* Why mass assignment may result in hidden parameters.
* How to identify hidden parameters.
* How to exploit mass assignment vulnerabilities.

These points are covered in our API Testing Academy topic.

### METHOD TWO

1. In Burp's browser, log in to the application using the credentials `wiener:peter`.
2. Click on the **Lightweight "l33t" Leather Jacket** product and add it to your basket.
3. Go to your basket and click **Place order**. Notice that you don't have enough credit for the purchase.
4. In **Proxy > HTTP history**, notice both the `GET` and `POST` API requests for `/api/checkout`.
5. Notice that the response to the `GET` request contains the same JSON structure as the `POST` request. Observe that the JSON structure in the `GET` response includes a `chosen_discount` parameter, which is not present in the `POST` request.
6. Right-click the `POST /api/checkout` request and select **Send to Repeater**.
7.  In Repeater, add the `chosen_discount` parameter to the request. The JSON should look like the following:

    `{ "chosen_discount":{ "percentage":0 }, "chosen_products":[ { "product_id":"1", "quantity":1 } ] }`
8. Send the request. Notice that adding the `chosen_discount` parameter doesn't cause an error.
9. Change the `chosen_discount` value to the string `"x"`, then send the request. Observe that this results in an error message as the parameter value isn't a number. This may indicate that the user input is being processed.
10. Change the `chosen_discount` percentage to `100`, then send the request to solve the lab.
