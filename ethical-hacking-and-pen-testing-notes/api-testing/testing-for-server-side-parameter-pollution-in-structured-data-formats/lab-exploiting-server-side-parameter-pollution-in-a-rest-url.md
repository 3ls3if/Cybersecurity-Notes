# âš— Lab: Exploiting server-side parameter pollution in a REST URL

To solve the lab, log in as the `administrator` and delete `carlos`.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Required knowledge**

To solve this lab, you'll need to know:

* How to identify whether a user input is included in a server-side URL path or query string.
* How to use [path traversal](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal) sequences to attempt to change a server-side request.
* How to discover API documentation.

These points are covered in our [API Testing](https://portswigger.net/web-security/api-testing) Academy topic.

## METHOD

### Study the behavior <a href="#study-the-behavior" id="study-the-behavior"></a>

1. In Burp's browser, trigger a password reset for the `administrator` user.
2. In **Proxy > HTTP history**, notice the `POST /forgot-password` request and the related `/static/js/forgotPassword.js` JavaScript file.
3. Right-click the `POST /forgot-password` request and select **Send to Repeater**.
4. In the **Repeater** tab, resend the request to confirm that the response is consistent.
5. Send a variety of requests with a modified username parameter value to determine whether the input is placed in the URL path of a server-side request without escaping:
   1.  Submit URL-encoded `administrator#` as the value of the `username` parameter.

       Notice that this returns an `Invalid route` error message. This suggests that the server may have placed the input in the path of a server-side request, and that the fragment has truncated some trailing data. Observe that the message also refers to an API definition.
   2.  Change the value of the username parameter from `administrator%23` to URL-encoded `administrator?`, then send the request.

       Notice that this also returns an `Invalid route` error message. This suggests that the input may be placed in a URL path, as the `?` character indicates the start of the query string and therefore truncates the URL path.
   3.  Change the value of the `username` parameter from `administrator%3F` to `./administrator` then send the request.

       Notice that this returns the original response. This suggests that the request may have accessed the same URL path as the original request. This further indicates that the input may be placed in the URL path.
   4.  Change the value of the username parameter from `./administrator` to `../administrator`, then send the request.

       Notice that this returns an `Invalid route` error message. This suggests that the request may have accessed an invalid URL path.

### Navigate to the API definition <a href="#navigate-to-the-api-definition" id="navigate-to-the-api-definition"></a>

1. Change the value of the username parameter from `../administrator` to `../%23`. Notice the `Invalid route` response.
2. Incrementally add further `../` sequences until you reach `../../../../%23` Notice that this returns a `Not found` response. This indicates that you've navigated outside the API root.
3.  At this level, add some common API definition filenames to the URL path. For example, submit the following:

    `username=../../../../openapi.json%23`

    Notice that this returns an error message, which contains the following API endpoint for finding users:

    `/api/internal/v1/users/{username}/field/{field}`

    Notice that this endpoint indicates that the URL path includes a parameter called `field`.

### Exploit the vulnerability <a href="#exploit-the-vulnerability" id="exploit-the-vulnerability"></a>

1.  Update the value of the `username` parameter, using the structure of the identified endpoint. Add an invalid value for the `field` parameter:

    `username=administrator/field/foo%23`

    Send the request. Notice that this returns an error message, because the API only supports the email field.
2.  Add `email` as the value of the `field` parameter:

    `username=administrator/field/email%23`

    Send the request. Notice that this returns the original response. This may indicate that the server-side application recognizes the injected `field` parameter and that `email` is a valid field type.
3.  In **Proxy > HTTP history**, review the `/static/js/forgotPassword.js` JavaScript file. Identify the password reset endpoint, which refers to the `passwordResetToken` parameter:

    `/forgot-password?passwordResetToken=${resetToken}`
4.  In the **Repeater** tab, change the value of the `field` parameter from `email` to `passwordResetToken`:

    `username=administrator/field/passwordResetToken%23`

    Send the request. Notice that this returns an error message, because the `passwordResetToken` parameter is not supported by the version of the API that is set by the application.
5.  Using the `/api/` endpoint that you identified earlier, change the version of the API in the value of the `username` parameter:

    `username=../../v1/users/administrator/field/passwordResetToken%23`

    Send the request. Notice that this returns a password reset token. Make a note of this.
6.  In Burp's browser, enter the password reset endpoint in the address bar. Add your password reset token as the value of the `reset_token` parameter. For example:

    `/forgot-password?passwordResetToken=123456789`
7. Set a new password.
8. Log in as the `administrator` using your password.
9. Go to the **Admin panel** and delete `carlos` to solve the lab.
