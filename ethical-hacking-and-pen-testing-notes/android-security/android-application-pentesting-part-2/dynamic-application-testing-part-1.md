* Install the Certificate on the device by clicking on it and give it a name and Ok



## Application Testing : Brute Force

### Push the apk on the emulator

* adb install InsecureBankv2.apk

### Brute Force&#x20;

* Open burp suite and android emulator side by side

* You can see that the request has been caputed by burp suite
* Right click on the request and send it to the intruder
* Setup the payloads and positions and start the attack



## Application Testing : Password Change

* Login to the application using the previously gained username and password
* Click on Change Password
* Enter a new password and click on Change Password button
