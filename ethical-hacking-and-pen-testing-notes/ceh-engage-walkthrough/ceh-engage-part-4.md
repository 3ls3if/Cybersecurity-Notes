# 4⃣ CEH Engage Part 4

An attacker has intruded into the CEHORG network with malicious intent. He has identified a vulnerability in a machine. He has encoded the machine's IP address and left it in the database. While auditing the database, the encoded file was identified by the database admin. Decode the EncodedFile.txt file in the Document folder in the "EH Workstation – 2" machine and enter the IP address as the answer. (Hint: Password to decode the file is Pa\$$w0rd)

The Access code of an employee was stolen from the CEHORG database. The attacker has encrypted the file using the Advance Encryption Package. You have been assigned a task to decrypt the file; the organization has retained the cipher file ""AccessCode.docx.aes"" in the Document folder in the ""EH Workstation – 2"" machine. Determine the access code by decrypting the file. Hint: Use ""qwerty"" as the decryption password. Note: Advanced Encryption Package is available at E:\CEH-Tools\CEHv12 Module 20 Cryptography\Cryptography Tools.

You have received a folder named "Archive" from a vendor. You suspect that someone might have tampered with the files during transmission. The Original hashes of the files have been sent by the sender separately and are stored in a file named FileHashes.txt stored in the Document folder in the "EH Workstation – 2" machine. Your task is to check the integrity of the files by comparing the MD5 hashes. Compare the hash values and determine the file name that has been tampered with. Note: Exclude the file extension in the answer field. The answer is case-sensitive.

CEHORG hosts multiple IoT devices and sensors to manage its supply chain fleet. You are assinged a task to examine the file "IOT Traffic.pcapng" located in the Home directory of the root user in the "EH Workstation - 1" machine. Analyze the packet and find the topic of the message sent to the sensor.

An employee in CEHORG has secretly acquired Confidential access ID through an application from the company. He has saved this information on the Downloads folder of his Android mobile phone. You have been assigned a task as an ethical hacker to access the file and delete it covertly. Enter the account information present in the file. Note: Only provide the numeric values in the answer field.



\-> Identify the IP address of mobile device from the IP range

```
nmap -p 5555 172.16.0.0/24
```

An attacker has hacked one of the employees android device in CEHORG and initiated LOIC attack from the device. You are an ethical hacker who had obtained a screenshot of the attack using a background application. Obtain the screenshot of the attack using PhoneSploit from the attacked mobile device and determine the targeted machine IP along with send method.
